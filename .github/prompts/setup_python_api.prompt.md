> **Best Practices:**
> - Ask clarifying questions before proceeding if any requirements or context are unclear.
> - Ask for permission before running commands, editing, or creating files. Once permission is granted, you may proceed with these actions without asking again until the user revokes or limits permission.

> **Context Management:**
> If the Python API project requirements are too complex for comprehensive setup, prioritize:
> 1. Security-critical authentication and authorization patterns
> 2. Production-ready configuration management and error handling
> 3. Integration effectiveness with common deployment and testing workflows
> Ask user to specify focus areas if scope exceeds setup capacity.

> **Analysis Validation:**
> - Mark implementation choices as "Best Practice" vs "Alternative" based on FastAPI documentation and industry standards
> - Reference specific FastAPI features, security patterns, or deployment configs when making recommendations
> - Provide confidence indicators: High/Medium/Low for each architectural decision
> - Note when additional project requirements would improve setup recommendations
