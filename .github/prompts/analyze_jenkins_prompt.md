# 🧪 Comprehensive Audit of Jenkins Pipelines and Architecture

You are a Principal DevOps and Security Engineer. Your task is to evaluate Jenkins usage in this repository or system. Assess how Jenkins Pipelines, plugins, agents, and integrations are configured. Identify gaps, security issues, and enhancement opportunities. Compare results against OWASP, DORA, and Jenkins best practices.

---

## 🎯 Step 1: Determine Analysis Context

Ask:
- “Which branch contains the Jenkinsfile or relevant job definitions?”
- “Is this Jenkins controller hosted on-prem or in the cloud (e.g., EC2, AKS, GKE)?”
- “Are you using freestyle jobs, declarative pipelines, or a mix?”

Once a branch is selected:
- Confirm: “Should I pull the latest code from `{{branch_name}}` before beginning?”
- If yes, run:
  ```bash
  git checkout {{branch_name}} && git pull
````

## 📦 Step 2: Common Jenkins Use Cases

| Category         | Common Jenkins Usage Examples                                            |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Build & Test** | Compile, run unit/integration tests, container builds, publish artifacts |
| **Deploy**       | Helm charts, kubectl, SSH deploys, Terraform plans, cloud infra          |
| **Infra Ops**    | Provision VMs/AKS/EKS, scale runners, rollback pipelines                 |
| **Security**     | DAST/SAST scanners, code signing, secret management                      |
| **Automation**   | Trigger downstream jobs, webhook chains, Jira and Slack integrations     |

## 🔧 Core Jenkins Components to Evaluate

* `Jenkinsfile` (declarative or scripted)
* Agent labels and execution environments
* Shared libraries (`@Library`) or `vars/`
* Plugin usage (e.g., Docker, GitHub, Pipeline, Credentials)
* Credentials management (via Jenkins Secrets or Vault)
* Build triggers (SCM polling, webhooks, cron)
* Parallel/Matrix stages
* Notification and approval logic
* Logs and audit trail

---

## ✅ Functional Review

* Do pipelines execute reliably across branches and environments?
* Are jobs isolated per environment or stage?
* Are retry logic, timeouts, and failure notifications present?
* Is test coverage gathered and published?

---

## 🛠️ Best Practice Evaluation

Compare to:

* [Jenkins Pipeline Best Practices (CloudBees)](https://www.cloudbees.com/blog/jenkins-pipeline-best-practices)
* [Jenkinsfile Syntax Guide](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/)

Evaluate:

* Use of `agent {}` blocks and execution control
* `environment {}` and `credentialsId` for secure secret usage
* Reuse via `@Library`, `input`, `when`, `post`, and `matrix`
* Declarative syntax over legacy scripted pipelines
* Use of `tools`, `timeout`, `options { skipDefaultCheckout() }`

---

## 🔄 Agent Scaling & Architecture

Compare to:

* [Jenkins Distributed Builds](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/using/using-agents/)
* [Kubernetes Plugin Docs](https://plugins.jenkins.io/kubernetes/)

Evaluate:

* Is this a single-node Jenkins or a distributed controller/agent setup?
* Are cloud autoscaling agents configured (EC2, GCP, AKS)?
* Are Docker or Kubernetes agents used for isolation?
* Resource tagging and label use (`agent { label 'docker' }`)
* Do agents support concurrent jobs and ephemeral environments?

---

## 🔒 Security Observations

Compare to:

* [OWASP Jenkins Security Guide](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-jenkins/)
* [Jenkins Security Docs](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/security/)

Evaluate:

* Are secrets stored securely (Credentials Plugin, HashiCorp Vault)?
* Is Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) enabled?
* Are jobs sandboxed or using `@NonCPS` scripts?
* Version pinning of plugins and agents?
* Are credentials injected only when needed?

---

## 🛡️ DAST/SAST & DevSecOps Coverage

Compare to:

* [OWASP Static Analysis Tools](https://owasp.org/www-community/Source_Code_Analysis_Tools)
* [SonarQube + Jenkins Guide](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube/latest/analyzing-source-code/jenkins/)

Evaluate:

* Are scanners like SonarQube, Snyk, Trivy, or Checkov integrated?
* Is scan output used in quality gates or merge blocking?
* License compliance tools (FOSSA, OWASP Dependency-Check)?
* Secure code metrics shown in build logs or dashboards?

---

## 🚀 Enhancement Opportunities

Compare to:

* [Jenkins Shared Libraries Docs](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/)
* [DORA DevOps Benchmarks](https://cloud.google.com/devops)

Recommend:

* Replace freestyle jobs with declarative pipelines
* Modularize pipelines using shared libraries
* Trigger pipelines from GitHub/GitLab via webhooks
* Auto-publish changelogs, coverage, and dashboards
* Use Jenkins Configuration-as-Code (JCasC) for reproducibility
