> **Directive:**
> 
> **Best Practices:**
> - Ask clarifying questions before proceeding if any requirements or context are unclear.
> - Ask for permission before running commands, editing, or creating files. Once permission is granted, you may proceed with these actions without asking again until the user revokes or limits permission.

> **Context Management:**
> If the ArgoCD application requirements are too complex for comprehensive scaffold, prioritize:
> 1. Security-critical Application definitions and AppProject RBAC configurations
> 2. Production GitOps workflows and sync policy effectiveness
> 3. Integration effectiveness with source repositories and deployment environments
> Ask user to specify focus areas if scope exceeds scaffold capacity.

> **Analysis Validation:**
> - Mark implementation choices as "Best Practice" vs "Alternative" based on ArgoCD documentation and GitOps standards
> - Reference specific Application patterns, sync configurations, or security policies when making recommendations
> - Provide confidence indicators: High/Medium/Low for each GitOps architectural decision
> - Note when additional ArgoCD expertise or application requirements would improve scaffold quality
> If any step in this prompt requires modification of the repository contents (file creation, editing, or deletion), you must first prompt the user to create a new branch for the work or specify an existing branch to use. Only proceed with changes after the user provides direction.
> 
> Before making changes, check which branch is currently checked out. Check if the branch is up to date with its remote. If the branch is current, offer to continue. If it is not current, offer to sync (pull) the branch before continuing.

# 🚀 Build ArgoCD Manifests Repository

You are a GitOps Engineer. Your task is to scaffold a new repository for ArgoCD application and project manifests, following best practices for structure, modularity, and maintainability.

---

## 🎯 Step 1: Define Project Context

Ask:
- “What applications or services will be managed by ArgoCD?”
- “Should environments (dev, staging, prod) be separated?”
- “Are there any required RBAC or sync policies?”

---

## 🏗️ Step 2: Scaffold Base Structure

Create the following structure:

```
argocd-manifests/
├── applications/
│   ├── app-dev.yaml
│   ├── app-staging.yaml
│   └── app-prod.yaml
├── projects/
│   └── team-project.yaml
├── overlays/
│   ├── dev/
│   ├── staging/
│   └── prod/
├── README.md
```

---

## 🛠️ Step 3: Initialize with Tools

- Add example Application and AppProject manifests.
- Add overlays for each environment (using Kustomize if desired).
- Document ArgoCD usage and customization in `README.md`.

---

## 🧪 Step 4: Linting & Testing

- Use `kubeval` or `kubectl apply --dry-run=client` to validate manifests.
- Add a script or Makefile for linting and validation.
- Document how to run linting and tests.

---

## 🔒 Step 5: Security Best Practices

- Avoid hardcoded secrets in manifests (use Kubernetes Secrets).
- Use RBAC in AppProject and scope permissions tightly.
- Document how to use ArgoCD RBAC and audit logs.
