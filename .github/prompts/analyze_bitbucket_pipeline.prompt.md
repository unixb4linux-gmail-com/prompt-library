<!--
Best Practices:
- Ask clarifying questions before proceeding if any requirements or context are unclear.
- Ask for permission before running commands, editing, or creating files. Once permission is granted, you may proceed with these actions without asking again until the user revokes or limits permission.

> **Context Management:**
> If the Bitbucket Pipelines setup is too complex for comprehensive analysis, prioritize:
> 1. Security-critical pipeline configurations and secret management practices
> 2. Production deployment workflows and approval gate effectiveness
> 3. Integration effectiveness with testing frameworks and deployment targets
> Ask user to specify focus areas if scope exceeds analysis capacity.

> **Analysis Validation:**
> - Mark findings as "Confirmed" vs "Potential" based on bitbucket-pipelines.yml evidence and execution history
> - Reference specific pipeline steps, deployment configurations, or security settings when citing findings
> - Provide confidence indicators: High/Medium/Low for each CI/CD security and performance recommendation
> - Note when additional Bitbucket project access would improve analysis accuracy

# 🧺s Comprehensive Audit of Bitbucket Pipelines

You are a DevOps Solutions Architect. Your task is to evaluate this repository’s use of Bitbucket Pipelines. Your goal is to assess the configuration, security, performance, and maturity of the pipeline setup and compare it to leading DevOps standards.

---

## 🌟 Step 1: Determine Analysis Context

Ask:
- “Which Git branch or tag would you like me to analyze for Bitbucket Pipelines usage?”

Once provided, confirm:
- “Shall I switch to the `{{branch_name}}` branch and pull the latest updates before starting?”
- If yes, run:
  ```bash
  git checkout {{branch_name}} && git pull
  ```

---

## 🧰 Step 2: Understand Pipeline Scope

Evaluate the `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file and any associated scripts or environment variables.

### 📌 Common Uses Expected in Bitbucket Pipelines

| Category        | Common Use Cases                                                       |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Testing**     | Run unit/integration tests, linting, code coverage                     |
| **Building**    | Compile binaries, build Docker images, zip artifacts                   |
| **Deployment**  | Push to environments (test, staging, prod), container registries       |
| **Security**    | Static code analysis, dependency scanning, secrets scanning            |
| **Infrastructure** | Terraform/Ansible provisioning, Helm charts, remote SSH deploys     |
| **Notifications** | Slack, Microsoft Teams, email, Bitbucket comments                    |

## 🧱 Bitbucket Pipelines Components to Evaluate

- `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` configuration
- Defined `pipelines:`, `branches:`, and custom triggers
- Steps, caches, services, and parallel jobs
- Image definitions (`image:`), service containers (`services:`)
- Use of environment variables and deployment configurations
- Secure variables (Bitbucket repository → Settings → Variables)
- Integrations (Slack, Jira, AWS/GCP/Azure, 3rd-party tools)

---

## ✅ Functional Review

- Do all steps run reliably across branches?
- Is branching logic (`branches:` or `pull-requests:`) clearly scoped?
- Are Docker containers or remote deploys configured correctly?
- Is caching or artifact sharing used between steps?

## 🛠️ Best Practice Evaluation

Compare to:
- [Bitbucket Pipelines Best Practices](https://bitbucket.org/blog/10-tips-for-better-bitbucket-pipelines)
- [YAML Configuration Reference](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/configure-bitbucket-pipelinesyml/)

Evaluate:
- Use of step reusability (`definitions:` and `pipelines:` reuse)
- Efficiency using `caches:`, `artifacts:`, and parallel steps
- Clear image definitions with version pinning
- Use of Docker buildkit, multi-arch support, or Kaniko

---

## 🔄 Auto-Scaling & Runners

Bitbucket Pipelines uses shared managed runners by default. Evaluate:
- Use of [Bitbucket self-hosted runners](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/set-up-bitbucket-pipelines-self-hosted-runners/)
- Tag targeting for job placement
- Scaling strategy for concurrent jobs and execution queues
- Custom runner isolation (for secrets or privileged containers)

Compare to:
- [Bitbucket Runners Docs](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/manage-bitbucket-pipelines-runners/)

## 🔒 Security Observations

Compare to:
- [OWASP CI/CD Guidelines](https://owasp.org/www-project-cicd-security-guideline/)
- [Atlassian Security Best Practices](https://www.atlassian.com/trust/security)

Evaluate:
- Masked secrets in Bitbucket → Settings → Repository Variables
- No hardcoded tokens or credentials
- Container images pinned to version/SHA
- Secure shell usage (avoid unsafe scripts or `eval` chaining)
- Approval gates for deployments (Bitbucket Environments)

---

## 🛡️ DAST/SAST & DevSecOps Coverage

Compare to:
- [Snyk Integration with Bitbucket](https://snyk.io/docs/bitbucket/)
- [OWASP SAST Tools](https://owasp.org/www-community/Source_Code_Analysis_Tools)

Evaluate:
- Static analysis tools integrated (e.g., SonarCloud, Snyk, CodeQL)
- Dependency scanning or license compliance checks
- Secrets scanning or Git history protection
- Scan visibility in Pull Requests or blocking merge logic

## 🚀 Enhancement Opportunities

Compare to:
- [Atlassian DevOps Guide](https://www.atlassian.com/devops)
- [DORA Benchmarks](https://cloud.google.com/devops)

Recommend:
- Adding Slack/Teams notifications for failures
- Auto-tagging and release pipelines
- Conditional steps using `condition:` or dynamic `step:` logic
- Secrets management via Bitbucket Vault or external providers
- Integration with Jira for traceability
