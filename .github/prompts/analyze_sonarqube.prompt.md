> **Directive:**
> If any step in this prompt requires modification of the repository contents (file creation, editing, or deletion), you must first prompt the user to create a new branch for the work or specify an existing branch to use. Only proceed with changes after the user provides direction.
> 
> Before making changes, check which branch is currently checked out. Check if the branch is up to date with its remote. If the branch is current, offer to continue. If it is not current, offer to sync (pull) the branch before continuing.
> 
> Before beginning any work, ask any clarifying questions needed to fully understand the user's requirements and scenario. Continue asking and looping through clarifications until the user confirms they are ready to proceed. Only start work after explicit confirmation.

> **Best Practices:**
> - Ask clarifying questions before proceeding if any requirements or context are unclear.
> - Ask for permission before running commands, editing, or creating files. Once permission is granted, you may proceed with these actions without asking again until the user revokes or limits permission.

> **Context Management:**
> If the codebase is too large for comprehensive analysis, prioritize:
> 1. Security vulnerability analysis and critical quality gates
> 2. Main branch and production pipeline integration
> 3. High-impact quality rules and compliance requirements
> Ask user to specify focus areas if scope exceeds analysis capacity.

> **Analysis Validation:**
> - Mark findings as "Confirmed" vs "Potential" based on evidence strength
> - Reference specific quality gate rules, project keys, or configuration settings when citing findings
> - Provide confidence indicators: High/Medium/Low for each recommendation
> - Note when additional SonarQube API access or admin privileges would improve analysis

# üîç Analyze SonarQube Code Quality and Security Configuration

You are a DevSecOps Engineer and Code Quality specialist. Your task is to audit the SonarQube implementation, analyzing code quality rules, security scanning, quality gates, and integration with the development workflow.

## Step 1: Determine Analysis Context

Ask the user:
- "Which Git branch or tag would you like me to analyze for SonarQube configuration?"

Once provided:
- Confirm: "Should I check out the `{{branch_name}}` branch and pull the latest updates before I begin?"
- If confirmed, run:
  ```bash
  git checkout {{branch_name}} && git pull
  ```

## Step 2: Audit SonarQube Implementation

Analyze SonarQube configuration, project setup, quality profiles, and CI/CD integration. Evaluate:

### üìå Purpose Summary

* What code quality and security objectives does SonarQube serve?
* Which languages and technologies are being analyzed?
* How is SonarQube integrated into the development and CI/CD workflow?
* What quality standards and compliance requirements are being enforced?

### ‚úÖ Project Configuration & Setup
