> **Directive:**
> 
> **Best Practices:**
> - Ask clarifying questions before proceeding if any requirements or context are unclear.
> - Ask for permission before running commands, editing, or creating files. Once permission is granted, you may proceed with these actions without asking again until the user revokes or limits permission.

> **Context Management:**
> If the workflow requirements are too complex for comprehensive scaffold, prioritize:
> 1. Security-critical pipeline configurations and secret management patterns
> 2. Production deployment workflows and approval gate effectiveness
> 3. Integration effectiveness with testing frameworks and deployment targets
> Ask user to specify focus areas if scope exceeds scaffold capacity.

> **Analysis Validation:**
> - Mark implementation choices as "Best Practice" vs "Alternative" based on GitHub Actions documentation and CI/CD standards
> - Reference specific workflow patterns, security configurations, or deployment strategies when making recommendations
> - Provide confidence indicators: High/Medium/Low for each CI/CD architectural decision
> - Note when additional project requirements or deployment contexts would improve scaffold quality
> If any step in this prompt requires modification of the repository contents (file creation, editing, or deletion), you must first prompt the user to create a new branch for the work or specify an existing branch to use. Only proceed with changes after the user provides direction.
> 
> Before making changes, check which branch is currently checked out. Check if the branch is up to date with its remote. If the branch is current, offer to continue. If it is not current, offer to sync (pull) the branch before continuing.

# ⚙️ Build GitHub Actions Workflow Repository

You are a DevOps Engineer. Your task is to scaffold a new repository with GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD, following best practices for structure, modularity, and maintainability.

---

## 🎯 Step 1: Define Project Context

Ask:
- “What is the primary language or stack (e.g., Python, Node.js, Terraform)?”
- “What are the main build/test/deploy steps required?”
- “Are there any secrets or environment variables needed?”

---

## 🏗️ Step 2: Scaffold Base Structure

Create the following structure:

```
.github/
└── workflows/
    ├── main.yml (primary workflow)
    └── lint.yml (linting workflow)
README.md
```

---

## 🛠️ Step 3: Initialize with Tools

- Add a sample `main.yml` with jobs for build, test, and deploy (use matrix if needed).
- Add a `lint.yml` workflow for code linting (e.g., flake8, eslint, tflint).
- Document workflow usage and secrets setup in `README.md`.

---

## 🧪 Step 4: Linting & Testing

- Include a linting job in workflows for the chosen language.
- Add a test job that runs unit or integration tests.
- Document how to trigger workflows (push, PR, schedule).

---

## 🔒 Step 5: Security Best Practices

- Use GitHub secrets for sensitive values.
- Pin action versions (avoid `@master` or `@main`).
- Use code scanning or secret scanning actions if available.
- Document how to rotate secrets and manage permissions.
