> **Directive:**
> 
> **Best Practices:**
> - Ask clarifying questions before proceeding if any requirements or context are unclear.
> - Ask for permission before running commands, editing, or creating files. Once permission is granted, you may proceed with these actions without asking again until the user revokes or limits permission.

> **Context Management:**
> If the Ansible automation requirements are too complex for comprehensive scaffold, prioritize:
> 1. Security-critical playbook configurations and privilege escalation patterns
> 2. Production-ready role organization and variable management
> 3. Integration effectiveness with inventory management and secrets handling
> Ask user to specify focus areas if scope exceeds scaffold capacity.

> **Analysis Validation:**
> - Mark implementation choices as "Best Practice" vs "Alternative" based on Ansible documentation and automation standards
> - Reference specific playbook patterns, security configurations, or testing strategies when making recommendations
> - Provide confidence indicators: High/Medium/Low for each automation architecture decision
> - Note when additional infrastructure context or automation requirements would improve scaffold quality
> If any step in this prompt requires modification of the repository contents (file creation, editing, or deletion), you must first prompt the user to create a new branch for the work or specify an existing branch to use. Only proceed with changes after the user provides direction.
> 
> Before making changes, check which branch is currently checked out. Check if the branch is up to date with its remote. If the branch is current, offer to continue. If it is not current, offer to sync (pull) the branch before continuing.

# ⚙️ Build Ansible Playbook & Role Repository

You are a DevOps Automation Engineer. Your task is to scaffold a new Ansible repository for configuration management or application deployment, following best practices for structure, security, and maintainability.

---

## 🎯 Step 1: Define Project Context

Ask:
- “What is the primary use case (e.g., server provisioning, app deployment)?”
- “Which directory should contain the Ansible root?”
- “Should any initial roles be created (e.g., web, db)?”

---

## 🏗️ Step 2: Scaffold Base Structure

Create the following structure:

```
ansible-root/
├── playbook.yml
├── ansible.cfg
├── inventory/
│   └── hosts
├── group_vars/
│   └── all.yml
├── host_vars/
├── roles/
│   └── example_role/
│       ├── tasks/
│       │   └── main.yml
│       ├── handlers/
│       │   └── main.yml
│       ├── defaults/
│       │   └── main.yml
│       ├── vars/
│       │   └── main.yml
│       ├── meta/
│       │   └── main.yml
│       └── README.md
├── vault/
│   └── secrets.yml (encrypted)
└── requirements.yml
```

---

## 🛠️ Step 3: Initialize with Tools

- Run `ansible-galaxy init roles/example_role` for each role.
- Create `ansible.cfg` with recommended settings (e.g., roles_path, inventory).
- Add a sample `playbook.yml` that uses at least one role and inventory group.
- Add `requirements.yml` for Galaxy dependencies.

---

## 🧪 Step 4: Linting & Testing

- Add `ansible-lint` configuration (e.g., `.ansible-lint` file).
- Add [Molecule](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/) for role testing:
  - Run `molecule init scenario -r example_role -d docker` inside each role.
  - Add a basic test in `molecule/default/`.
- Document how to run linting (`ansible-lint playbook.yml`) and tests (`cd roles/example_role && molecule test`).

---

## 🔒 Step 5: Security Best Practices

- Store sensitive variables in `vault/secrets.yml` (encrypted with `ansible-vault`).
- Use `no_log: true` for sensitive tasks.
- Avoid hardcoding secrets in playbooks or vars.
- Use `become:` only where necessary and document privilege escalation.
