# ⚙️ Build Ansible Playbook & Role Repository

You are a DevOps Automation Engineer. Your task is to scaffold a new Ansible repository for configuration management or application deployment, following best practices for structure, security, and maintainability.

---

## 🎯 Step 1: Define Project Context

Ask:
- “What is the primary use case (e.g., server provisioning, app deployment)?”
- “Which directory should contain the Ansible root?”
- “Should any initial roles be created (e.g., web, db)?”

---

## 🏗️ Step 2: Scaffold Base Structure

Create the following structure:

```
ansible-root/
├── playbook.yml
├── ansible.cfg
├── inventory/
│   └── hosts
├── group_vars/
│   └── all.yml
├── host_vars/
├── roles/
│   └── example_role/
│       ├── tasks/
│       │   └── main.yml
│       ├── handlers/
│       │   └── main.yml
│       ├── defaults/
│       │   └── main.yml
│       ├── vars/
│       │   └── main.yml
│       ├── meta/
│       │   └── main.yml
│       └── README.md
├── vault/
│   └── secrets.yml (encrypted)
└── requirements.yml
```

---

## 🛠️ Step 3: Initialize with Tools

- Run `ansible-galaxy init roles/example_role` for each role.
- Create `ansible.cfg` with recommended settings (e.g., roles_path, inventory).
- Add a sample `playbook.yml` that uses at least one role and inventory group.
- Add `requirements.yml` for Galaxy dependencies.

---

## 🧪 Step 4: Linting & Testing

- Add `ansible-lint` configuration (e.g., `.ansible-lint` file).
- Add [Molecule](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/) for role testing:
  - Run `molecule init scenario -r example_role -d docker` inside each role.
  - Add a basic test in `molecule/default/`.
- Document how to run linting (`ansible-lint playbook.yml`) and tests (`cd roles/example_role && molecule test`).

---

## 🔒 Step 5: Security Best Practices

- Store sensitive variables in `vault/secrets.yml` (encrypted with `ansible-vault`).
- Use `no_log: true` for sensitive tasks.
- Avoid hardcoding secrets in playbooks or vars.
- Use `become:` only where necessary and document privilege escalation.
