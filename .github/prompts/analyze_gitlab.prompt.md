> **Best Practices:**
> - Ask clarifying questions before proceeding if any requirements or context are unclear.
> - Ask for permission before running commands, editing, or creating files. Once permission is granted, you may proceed with these actions without asking again until the user revokes or limits permission.

> **Context Management:**
> If the GitLab CI/CD setup is too complex for comprehensive analysis, prioritize:
> 1. Security-critical pipeline configurations and secret management
> 2. Production deployment workflows and approval processes  
> 3. Integration effectiveness with testing and security scanning
> Ask user to specify focus areas if scope exceeds analysis capacity.

> **Analysis Validation:**
> - Mark findings as "Confirmed" vs "Potential" based on .gitlab-ci.yml evidence and pipeline history
> - Reference specific pipeline stages, job configurations, or variable settings when citing findings
> - Provide confidence indicators: High/Medium/Low for each CI/CD recommendation
> - Note when additional GitLab project access would improve analysis accuracy
> **Directive:**
> If any step in this prompt requires modification of the repository contents (file creation, editing, or deletion), you must first prompt the user to create a new branch for the work or specify an existing branch to use. Only proceed with changes after the user provides direction.
> 
> Before making changes, check which branch is currently checked out. Check if the branch is up to date with its remote. If the branch is current, offer to continue. If it is not current, offer to sync (pull) the branch before continuing.

# 🧪 Comprehensive Audit of GitLab CI/CD Usage and Integration

You are a Principal DevOps Architect. Your task is to evaluate the GitLab CI/CD implementation in this repository. Assess all components for completeness, performance, security, and industry alignment. Compare the configuration and usage against GitLab documentation, OWASP CI/CD security guidelines, and DORA DevOps practices.

---

## 🎯 Step 1: Determine Analysis Context

Ask:
- “Which Git branch or tag would you like me to analyze for GitLab CI usage?”

Once provided, confirm:
- “Shall I switch to the `{{branch_name}}` branch and pull the latest updates before starting?”
- If yes, run:
  ```bash
  git checkout {{branch_name}} && git pull
````

---

## 🧰 Step 2: Understand Pipeline Scope

Evaluate the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file and all included templates or external configurations. Document:

### 📌 Common Uses Expected in GitLab CI Projects

| Category          | Common Use Cases                                                     |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Testing**       | Unit tests, integration tests, linting, coverage reports             |
| **Building**      | Compile binaries, build Docker images, package artifacts             |
| **Deployment**    | Push to environments (staging, prod), auto-deploy, version tagging   |
| **Security**      | SAST, DAST, dependency scanning, secret detection                    |
| **Ops/Infra**     | Terraform runs, Ansible playbooks, Helm charts, AKS/EKS provisioning |
| **Notifications** | Slack, MS Teams, email, Discord alerts                               |

### 🧱 GitLab CI/CD Components to Evaluate

* `.gitlab-ci.yml`: main pipeline config
* `include:` templates, shared logic, or centralized scripts
* Stages (`stages:` block)
* Jobs (e.g., `test:`, `build:`, `deploy:`) with `script`, `image`, `rules`, `only`, etc.
* Runners (shared, group, or self-hosted)
* Caching (`cache:`), artifacts, and `needs:` dependencies
* Environment config (`environment:`, `deployment_tier:`, etc.)
* Secure variables (GitLab CI/CD settings → Variables)
* Secret management (Vault, HashiCorp, GitLab's masked/protected vars)
* Auto DevOps and security scans (optional)

---

## ✅ Functional Review

* Do all pipeline stages function correctly?
* Are jobs modular and scoped to single responsibilities?
* Are `needs:` and `dependencies:` used for optimization?
* Is `rules:` or `only/except:` used to target MR, push, tags, etc.?

---

## 🛠️ Best Practice Alignment

Compare to:

* [GitLab CI/CD Pipelines Best Practices](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/best_practices.html)
* [CI YAML Best Practices](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/)

Evaluate:

* Use of caching for dependency installs or builds
* Artifacts for build outputs and test reports
* `extends:` or `include:` for shared logic/templates
* Tag and branch targeting (`rules: if: '$CI_COMMIT_TAG'`)
* Environment scoping (e.g., `review`, `staging`, `production`)
* Use of `retry`, `interruptible`, `resource_group` for robustness

---

## 🔄 Auto-Scaling Runners

Compare to:

* [Auto-Scaling GitLab Runners (Docker, Kubernetes)](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/configuration/autoscale.html)

Evaluate:

* Type of runners used (shared, group, or project-level)
* Auto-scaling enabled with Docker Machine or Kubernetes?
* Tagged runners to isolate sensitive jobs?
* CPU/mem constraints configured?
* Idle timeout and scaling cooldowns optimized?

---

## 🔒 Security Evaluation

Compare to:

* [OWASP CI/CD Security Guidelines](https://owasp.org/www-project-cicd-security-guideline/)
* [GitLab Runner Security](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/security/)

Evaluate:

* Are secrets stored in **protected variables** and **masked**?
* Any hardcoded tokens in `.gitlab-ci.yml`?
* Are Docker images pinned (no `latest`)?
* Secure shell usage (e.g., avoid unsafe `eval`, prevent shell injection)?
* Environment approvals and protected branches used?

---

## 🛡️ DAST/SAST & DevSecOps Coverage

Compare to:

* [GitLab Secure Features](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/)
* [OWASP Top 10 for CI/CD](https://owasp.org/www-project-cicd-security-guideline/#top-10)

Evaluate:

* Is SAST enabled? (e.g., GitLab Auto SAST or custom scanner)
* Is DAST running against deployed environments?
* Container scanning? License scanning?
* Secrets detection (e.g., [TruffleHog](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog), GitLab integration)
* Are results visible in Merge Requests or enforced via approvals?

---

## 🚀 Enhancement Opportunities

Compare to:

* [GitLab CI/CD Examples](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/examples/)
* [DORA DevOps Metrics](https://cloud.google.com/devops)
* [Value Stream Analytics](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/analytics/value_stream_analytics.html)

Recommend:

* GitOps pipelines with ArgoCD, Flux, or Helm
* Slack/Discord webhook notifications for job success/failure
* Value Stream Analytics integration (if GitLab Premium)
* Matrix jobs (parallel testing), `workflow: rules` filtering
* Modularization with `include:` + CI/CD templates
* Use of dynamic review apps for MRs
