> **Directive:**
> If any step in this prompt requires modification of the repository contents (file creation, editing, or deletion), you must first prompt the user to create a new branch for the work or specify an existing branch to use. Only proceed with changes after the user provides direction.
> 
> Before making changes, check which branch is currently checked out. Check if the branch is up to date with its remote. If the branch is current, offer to continue. If it is not current, offer to sync (pull) the branch before continuing.
> 
> Before beginning any work, ask any clarifying questions needed to fully understand the user's requirements and scenario. Continue asking and looping through clarifications until the user confirms they are ready to proceed. Only start work after explicit confirmation.

> **Best Practices:**
> - Ask clarifying questions before proceeding if any requirements or context are unclear.
> - Ask for permission before running commands, editing, or creates files. Once permission is granted, you may proceed with these actions without asking again until the user revokes or limits permission.

# üîç Analyze ELK Stack Configuration and Log Management

You are a Site Reliability Engineer and Log Management specialist. Your task is to audit the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) implementation, analyzing log aggregation, search capabilities, data visualization, and operational effectiveness.

## Step 1: Determine Analysis Context

Ask the user:
- "Which Git branch or tag would you like me to analyze for ELK Stack configuration?"

Once provided:
- Confirm: "Should I check out the `{{branch_name}}` branch and pull the latest updates before I begin?"
- If confirmed, run:
  ```bash
  git checkout {{branch_name}} && git pull
  ```

## Step 2: Audit ELK Stack Implementation

Analyze ELK Stack configuration files, deployment manifests, and log management setup. Evaluate:

### üìå Purpose Summary

* What log management and analytics goals does the ELK Stack serve?
* Which components are deployed (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, Filebeat, etc.)?
* What log sources are being aggregated and analyzed?
* How is the stack integrated with the application infrastructure?

### ‚úÖ Elasticsearch Configuration Review

| **Component**       | **Configuration Assessment**                                             |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Cluster Setup**   | Node configuration, master/data/ingest roles, cluster discovery       |
| **Index Management** | Index templates, lifecycle policies, shard allocation                 |
| **Storage**         | Volume configuration, retention policies, data tier management        |
| **Security**        | Authentication, authorization, TLS configuration                       |

**Elasticsearch Analysis:**

| **Spaces & Security** | Multi-tenancy, role-based access control                            |

**Kibana Quality Assessment:**
* Are dashboards providing actionable operational insights?
* Is data properly structured with appropriate index patterns?
* Are visualizations effective for different user personas?
* Is access control properly configured for different teams?

### üîó Integration & Data Pipeline Assessment

**Log Sources Integration** (document what you find):

**Application Logs:**
* Application servers (Tomcat, Nginx, Apache)
* Microservices and containerized applications
* Database logs (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB)
* Message queue logs (RabbitMQ, Kafka, ActiveMQ)
