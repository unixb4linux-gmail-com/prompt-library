# 🛡️ Build Snyk Security Integration Repository

You are a DevSecOps Engineer. Your task is to scaffold a new repository for integrating Snyk security scanning into code and container workflows, following best practices for structure, automation, and maintainability.

---

## 🎯 Step 1: Define Project Context

Ask:
- “What languages or platforms will be scanned (e.g., Node.js, Python, Docker)?”
- “Should container images be scanned as well as source code?”
- “Are there any compliance or reporting requirements?”

---

## 🏗️ Step 2: Scaffold Base Structure

Create the following structure:

```
snyk-integration/
├── src/ (application code)
├── Dockerfile (if containerized)
├── .snyk (ignore file)
├── snyk.config.yml (optional, for advanced config)
├── test/
│   └── example.test.js
├── README.md
```

---

## 🛠️ Step 3: Initialize with Tools

- Add Snyk CLI to dev dependencies (e.g., `npm install snyk --save-dev`).
- Add a sample `.snyk` ignore file.
- Add a sample test file in `test/`.
- Document Snyk usage and configuration in `README.md`.

---

## 🧪 Step 4: Linting & Testing

- Add a linting tool for the chosen language (e.g., eslint, flake8).
- Document how to run `snyk test` and `snyk monitor`.
- Add a test script to validate Snyk integration.

---

## 🔒 Step 5: Security Best Practices

- Store Snyk tokens in environment variables or CI secrets.
- Regularly update dependencies and scan for vulnerabilities.
- Use `snyk protect` for runtime patching (if supported).
- Document how to triage and fix vulnerabilities.
