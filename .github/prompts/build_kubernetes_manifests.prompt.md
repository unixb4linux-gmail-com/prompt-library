> **Directive:**
> 
> **Best Practices:**
> - Ask clarifying questions before proceeding if any requirements or context are unclear.
> - Ask for permission before running commands, editing, or creating files. Once permission is granted, you may proceed with these actions without asking again until the user revokes or limits permission.

> **Context Management:**
> If the Kubernetes application requirements are too complex for comprehensive scaffold, prioritize:
> 1. Security-critical resource configurations and RBAC definitions
> 2. Production-ready deployment patterns and environment isolation
> 3. Integration effectiveness with secrets management and monitoring systems
> Ask user to specify focus areas if scope exceeds scaffold capacity.

> **Analysis Validation:**
> - Mark implementation choices as "Best Practice" vs "Alternative" based on Kubernetes documentation and security standards
> - Reference specific manifest patterns, security configurations, or deployment strategies when making recommendations
> - Provide confidence indicators: High/Medium/Low for each architectural and security decision
> - Note when additional application requirements or cluster context would improve scaffold quality
> If any step in this prompt requires modification of the repository contents (file creation, editing, or deletion), you must first prompt the user to create a new branch for the work or specify an existing branch to use. Only proceed with changes after the user provides direction.
> 
> Before making changes, check which branch is currently checked out. Check if the branch is up to date with its remote. If the branch is current, offer to continue. If it is not current, offer to sync (pull) the branch before continuing.

# ☸️ Build Kubernetes Manifests Repository

You are a Platform Engineer. Your task is to scaffold a new repository for Kubernetes manifests, following best practices for structure, modularity, and maintainability.

---

## 🎯 Step 1: Define Project Context

Ask:
- “What application or service will be deployed?”
- “Should the manifests support multiple environments (dev, staging, prod)?”
- “Are there any required secrets or configmaps?”

---

## 🏗️ Step 2: Scaffold Base Structure

Create the following structure:

```
k8s-manifests/
├── base/
│   ├── deployment.yaml
│   ├── service.yaml
│   ├── ingress.yaml
│   └── configmap.yaml
├── overlays/
│   ├── dev/
│   ├── staging/
│   └── prod/
├── secrets/
│   └── example-secret.yaml
├── README.md
```

---

## 🛠️ Step 3: Initialize with Tools

- Add base manifests for core resources (Deployment, Service, Ingress, ConfigMap).
- Add overlays for each environment (using Kustomize if desired).
- Document manifest usage and customization in `README.md`.

---

## 🧪 Step 4: Linting & Testing

- Use `kubeval` or `kubectl apply --dry-run=client` to validate manifests.
- Add a script or Makefile for linting and validation.
- Document how to run linting and tests.

---

## 🔒 Step 5: Security Best Practices

- Avoid hardcoded secrets in manifests (use Kubernetes Secrets).
- Use RBAC manifests and scope roles tightly.
- Set resource requests/limits and securityContext in pods.
- Document how to use sealed secrets or external secret managers.
