> **Best Practices:**

# ☁️ Build AWS EKS Cluster Repository

You are a Cloud Platform Engineer. Your task is to scaffold a new repository for deploying and managing an AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) cluster, following best practices for structure, security, and maintainability.

---

## 🎯 Step 1: Define Project Context

Ask:
- “What is the AWS account and region for the EKS cluster?”
- “Should the cluster use managed node groups, Fargate, or both?”
- “Are there specific workloads or namespaces to pre-create?”

---

## 🏗️ Step 2: Scaffold Base Structure

Create the following structure:

```
eks-cluster/
├── iac/
│   ├── main.tf (or eks-cluster.yaml for CloudFormation)
│   ├── variables.tf
│   ├── outputs.tf
│   └── README.md
├── manifests/
│   ├── deployment.yaml
│   ├── service.yaml
│   └── configmap.yaml
├── addons/
│   ├── vpc-cni.yaml
│   ├── coredns.yaml
│   └── kube-proxy.yaml
├── security/
│   ├── rbac.yaml
│   ├── network-policy.yaml
│   └── kms-policy.json
├── monitoring/
│   ├── prometheus.yaml
│   └── cloudwatch-agent.yaml
├── test/
│   └── test_cluster.sh
├── README.md
```

---

## 🛠️ Step 3: Initialize with Tools

- Use Terraform (`terraform init`) or CloudFormation to provision EKS.
- Add sample manifests for workloads and add-ons.
- Add RBAC, network policy, and KMS policy examples.
- Document setup and usage in `README.md`.

---

## 🧪 Step 4: Linting & Testing

- Use `tflint` or `cfn-lint` for IaC.
- Use `kubeval` or `kubectl apply --dry-run=client` for manifests.
- Add a test script to validate cluster and workload deployment.
- Document how to run linting and tests.

---

## 🔒 Step 5: Security Best Practices

- Use IAM roles for service accounts (IRSA) and least-privilege policies.
- Enable KMS encryption for secrets.
- Restrict public endpoints and use network policies.
- Document how to enable audit logging and secure add-ons.
