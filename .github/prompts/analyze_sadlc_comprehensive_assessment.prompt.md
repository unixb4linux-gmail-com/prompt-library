NIST SSDF: PW.1 partially implemented

Recommendation:
- Update SADLC to mandate threat modeling for all new applications
- Implement threat modeling training for development teams
- Create threat model templates and tools

Priority: Critical
Effort: Medium (4-6 weeks)
```

Remediation Verification: SAST re-scan + penetration testing
```

#### CI/CD Security Control Assessment

**Pipeline Security Findings:**
```
Finding ID: CICD-001
Category: CI/CD Security
Severity: High
Confidence: High

Title: Missing Security Gates in Production Deployment Pipeline
Description: Production deployment pipeline lacks mandatory security scanning and approval gates.
Evidence:
- Jenkins pipeline configuration review
- No SAST/DAST integration before production deployment
- Missing security team approval requirement
- No automated rollback on security scan failures
Risk: Vulnerable code deployed to production without security validation
Impact: Potential production security incidents, compliance violations

Recommendation:
- Integrate SAST scanning with pipeline blocking on high/critical findings

Evidence:
- AWS WAF configuration review shows only basic OWASP Core Rule Set
- No custom rules for application-specific threats
- Rate limiting not configured for API endpoints
- No blocking mode enabled (monitoring only)
Impact: Limited protection against common web attacks
OWASP Top 10 Relevance: Multiple categories inadequately protected

Recommendation:
