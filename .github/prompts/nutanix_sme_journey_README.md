# Nutanix SME Journey Prompt Pack

## How to Use

This bundle provides six structured prompts to guide your journey from beginner to Nutanix SME. Each prompt is designed to be used in ChatGPT with the following conventions:

### Conventions
- Always **ask clarifying questions first**.  
- Do not proceed until the user responds with `continue`, `next`, or `proceed`.  
- Provide **UI workflows** (Prism, NKP, NDB). If CLI steps are required, note that they should be delivered as **Claude prompts** instead.  
- Require **evidence artifacts** (console output, screenshots, IDs).  
- End each section with an **exit criteria checklist**.  
- Include **quizzes** for knowledge retention.  
- Mention compliance impacts (HIPAA/PCI/SOX) where relevant.
