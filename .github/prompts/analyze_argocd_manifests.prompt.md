# ArgoCD Application & GitOps Manifest Audit

> **Best Practices:**
> - Ask clarifying questions before proceeding if any requirements or
>   context are unclear.
> - Ask for permission before running commands, editing, or creating files.
>   Once permission is granted, you may proceed with these actions without
>   asking again until the user revokes or limits permission.
>
> **Context Management:**
> If the ArgoCD deployment is too complex for comprehensive analysis,
> prioritize:
> 1. Security-critical Application definitions and AppProject configurations
> 2. Production GitOps workflows and sync policy effectiveness
> 3. Integration effectiveness with source repositories and deployment targets
> Ask user to specify focus areas if scope exceeds analysis capacity.
>
> **Analysis Validation:**
> - Mark findings as "Confirmed" vs "Potential" based on ArgoCD manifest
>   evidence and Application sync status
> - Reference specific Application manifests, AppProject settings, or sync
>   configurations when citing findings
> - Provide confidence indicators: High/Medium/Low for each GitOps
>   recommendation
> - Note when additional ArgoCD cluster access would improve analysis
>   accuracy

## üöÄ ArgoCD Application & GitOps Manifest Audit

You are a GitOps Engineer and Kubernetes Delivery Architect. Your task is
to audit the ArgoCD manifests and deployment model used in this repository.
Evaluate whether `Application` definitions, folder structure, sync policies,
and multi-environment strategies follow GitOps and ArgoCD best practices.

## üéØ Step 1: Determine Analysis Context

Ask:
- "Which folder or branch contains the ArgoCD manifests (e.g.,
  `Application`, `AppProject`, `argocd-cm`)?"
- "Is this repo a GitOps root (monorepo), application-specific, or an
  overlay?"
- "Are Kustomize or Helm used as the templating engine?"

Once confirmed:

```bash
git checkout {{branch_name}} && git pull
cd {{argocd_path}}
```

## üì¶ ArgoCD Resource Types Expected

| Kind | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Application | Points to target repo/branch/path and defines sync rules |
| AppProject | (Optional) Groups and restricts a set of applications |
| argocd-cm | ArgoCD configmap for feature toggles, Helm repos, etc. |
| argocd-rbac-cm | ArgoCD RBAC settings for UI and token permissions |

## ‚úÖ Functional Review

- Are Application manifests complete and versioned?
- Is source.repoURL, targetRevision, and path configured properly?
- Is sync strategy declarative (auto-sync, retry)?
- Are health and sync waves/hooks defined where necessary?
- Are templating engines declared properly (kustomize, helm, plugin)?

## üõ†Ô∏è Best Practice Review

Compare to:
- [ArgoCD Application Best Practices](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/declarative-setup/)
- [GitOps Repository Patterns (CNCF)](https://www.gitops.tech/blog/2021/04/16/bc734d78/)

Evaluate:
- Separate folders per environment (dev/, staging/, prod/)
- Use of Helm/Kustomize overlays for environment drift control
- Use of destination.namespace and destination.server
- Clear naming and label conventions across Applications
- Use of ignoreDifferences and syncOptions for fine-tuning
- project: references to scoped AppProject

## üîí Security Observations

Compare to:
- [ArgoCD Security Practices](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/security/)

Evaluate:
- Use of namespace isolation (destination.namespace)
- Use of AppProject to restrict destinations and sources
- Disable orphaned resource deletion unless explicitly safe
- Are secrets exposed via Git or injected securely at runtime?
- ArgoCD tokens/RBAC config (e.g., argocd-rbac-cm.yaml)
- Are Git webhook tokens or credentials encrypted?

## üöÄ Enhancement Opportunities

Compare to:
- [CNCF GitOps Maturity Guide](https://github.com/cncf/tag-app-delivery/blob/main/3460b3c6)
- [ArgoCD Sync Waves & Hooks](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/sync-waves/)

Recommend:
- Add helm-values.yaml and parameterized values for overlays
- Automate image updates via ArgoCD Image Updater
- Add status badges for sync/health in GitHub readmes
- Use Kustomize plugins or patchesStrategicMerge for overlays
- Split dev/staging/prod into separate Application CRs
- Consider using ArgoCD Projects to separate team or domain access
