# Prompt: Dockerize Application
# Directive:
If any step in this prompt requires modification of the repository contents (file creation, editing, or deletion), you must first prompt the user to create a new branch for the work or specify an existing branch to use. Only proceed with changes after the user provides direction.

Write a Dockerfile to containerize the given application. Include best practices for security, multi-stage builds, and environment variable configuration.
