# My Workflows

This folder contains structured, repeatable AI-augmented workflows designed to streamline complex or repetitive tasks — like feature development, test audits, or refactoring. Each workflow acts like a junior developer following a reliable checklist, with prompts and checkpoints for your feedback.

You can use these in Cursor, GPT, or other tools by copying, tweaking, or even chaining them together.

Workflows are broken into clear steps, designed to be interrupted, resumed, or integrated into your toolchain.

## Example Workflows

- `feature-dev.mdc` — Write specs and break down work collaboratively.
- `test-sanity.mdc` — Identify weak or unnecessary tests.
- `refactor-explorer.mdc` — Suggest small, safe refactor opportunities.
- `bug-sleuth.mdc` — Help isolate causes of flakiness or failures.
- `docs-improver.mdc` — Review README, inline docs, and suggest upgrades.

Each file is standalone. You can drop it into projects, agents, or workflows as needed.
