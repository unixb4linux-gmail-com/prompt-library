# Test Sanity Sweep

Use this workflow to periodically audit and improve your test suite with minimal effort.

## Step 1: Alphabetical Review

Prompt:
> Review tests alphabetically by file name or structure. Flag tests that are redundant, flaky, or offer no meaningful coverage.

## Step 2: Generate Fix Tasks

Prompt:
> For each flagged test, suggest a fix:
- Delete / merge / rewrite
- Improve assertions
- Refactor setup logic

☑ Output a fix plan as a checklist.

## Step 3: Focused Fix Mode

Prompt:
> Pick one task from the checklist and execute. Wait for user approval before continuing.

Repeat as needed — this can run continuously as a background hygiene workflow.
