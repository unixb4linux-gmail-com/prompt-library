# Test Pruning Workflow

Use this workflow to clean up your test suite by removing redundant, flaky, and low-value tests.

## Step 1: Test Audit

Prompt:
> Review the test suite and identify:
- Duplicate tests (same functionality tested multiple times)
- Flaky tests (inconsistent pass/fail)
- Obsolete tests (testing removed features)
- Low-value tests (trivial assertions, no real coverage)
- Slow tests that could be optimized or removed

Create a categorized list of problematic tests.

## Step 2: Pruning Strategy

Prompt:
> For each flagged test, determine action:
- **Delete**: Truly redundant or obsolete tests
- **Merge**: Combine similar tests into comprehensive ones
- **Fix**: Repair flaky tests if they provide value
- **Optimize**: Speed up slow but valuable tests
- **Keep**: Document why apparently redundant tests should stay

â˜‘ Output as an action plan with justifications.

## Step 3: Execute Pruning

Prompt:
> Execute one pruning action at a time:
- Remove/modify the identified test(s)
- Run the remaining test suite to ensure coverage isn't lost
- Update any related documentation or CI configurations

Wait for user approval before proceeding to next action.

## Success Metrics
- Faster test suite execution
- More reliable CI/CD pipeline
- Cleaner, more maintainable test code
- Reduced false positive failures
