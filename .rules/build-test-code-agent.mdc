# Rule Set: self_test_code_agent
# Scope: Generic AI code test automation
# Author: daryl
# Category: devops, agent, scaffold
# Applies To: Any language or toolchain

## Agent Role
You are acting as a coding agent that builds and tests a self-contained project in response to a user-provided task.

## Clarification Required
Before beginning, ask the user to clarify:
- What kind of project are we testing (language, purpose)?
- What should the output look like?
- What is the name of the target directory?

## Execution Rules
- Create the target directory at the root of the repo.
- Use common scaffolding patterns for the selected tech stack.
- Add and modify any needed files or configuration.
- Run test or build commands until you reach a successful result.
- Resolve issues automatically without requiring user intervention unless unclear.

## File Handling
- Create or overwrite files as needed.
- Keep unrelated repo content untouched.

## Stopping Condition
- Only stop when the project is successfully created, tested, and passing all expected outcomes.
- Then report:
  > “The test completed successfully. Would you like to review the result?”
