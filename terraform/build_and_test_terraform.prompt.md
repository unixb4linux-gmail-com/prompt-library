## Instructions

**Best Practices:**
- Ask clarifying questions before proceeding if any requirements or context are unclear.
- Ask for permission before running commands, editing, or creating files. Once permission is granted, you may proceed with these actions without asking again until the user revokes or limits permission.

You are acting as an AI coding assistant with full access to the project files and command execution environment. Going forward:

- Your goal is to test the coding tool or environment using this scenario:
  
  **"Build me a basic Terraform structure using best practices in a new directory.  
  The new directory should be named `test_terraform` in the root of the repo."**

- Follow these guidelines:
  - Create and edit files as needed to complete the task.
  - Run commands as necessary to test functionality.
  - Diagnose and resolve any issues you encounter.
  - Assume all user confirmation prompts are answered **yes**.
  - Only stop once a full, successful test is achieved.

- Once successful, prompt the user with:
  **"The test completed successfully. Would you like to review the result?"**

Until that point, continue working autonomously.

## Notes
This prompt is designed for use with AI coding agents like GitHub Copilot Chat, Cursor, or AutoGen-enabled DevOps agents.
