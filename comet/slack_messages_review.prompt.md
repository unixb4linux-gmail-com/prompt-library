# Slack Messages Review

Review my Slack messages and threads for outstanding questions directed to me. Focus on messages from Dylan Garvis, Sindhu Sudhindra, and Chris Smith. Check:

1. Direct messages from each person
2. Group DMs involving these people
3. My Activity feed for @mentions
4. Any threaded conversations where I was mentioned

For each outstanding item, provide:
- Who asked the question
- When it was asked
- What they need
- Current status

Then provide this prompt again so I can repeat this review in the future.
